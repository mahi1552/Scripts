# DailyExpenseWhatsap2Excel

Whatsap can be used to manage daily expense notes.
This is very handy for a couple or family who wish to manage 
there daily expense overview together, but at the same they do not want to use an extra app for it.

Start by creating a group where you and your partner, posts daily expenses in it.

Example:
Water 40

At the end of the month, copy all these chats to a text file, from whatsap web.
Then you will have file like the example.txt in this directory.

Use the python script to convert the text file to an excel sheet to have better overview.
You may want to modify the input_file path as required.
